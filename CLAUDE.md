# MMM-Rule30 — context for Claude sessions

Charles's MagicMirror² module: Wolfram's rule 30, grown from one cell a row at a time, for his
hallway mirror, as one page in a rotation of pages. Split out of MMM-ChaosTheory on 2026-09-28
with its history (it was the `rule30` simulation of that module's chaos page).

## Files

- `MMM-Rule30.js` — module shell: one canvas plus an HTML caption (equations + live readout,
  updated 2×/s). A new start every `cycleSeconds` and on each `resume()`. Loop: `setTimeout`
  until a frame is due, then one `requestAnimationFrame`. `suspend()` stops it; a sim with
  `resting = true` is polled only every 500 ms; while MagicMirror fades the module out (`hidden`
  is set at the start, `suspend()` comes after), frames draw nothing. `turns: { of, at }`: only
  every nth showing; otherwise the wrapper gets `display: none` and nothing starts.
- `simulations/rule30.js` — the `rule30` sim on `window.Rule30Simulations`.
  `new = left ^ (centre | right)` on a line wide enough never to reach its ends; 3 px cells,
  5 rows a second (300 rows of a 900 px canvas in a minute), then rests. Each frame draws at most
  a row or two: one strip of the canvas. The centre column is drawn in blue; the readout keeps
  its latest 48 bits and how often it has been 1.
- UMD-style, so it runs in Node: `tests/rule30.test.js` (`node --test`, no dependencies): the
  first rows, the centre column's first 32 bits against OEIS A051023, its even split over 20,000
  rows, and that the module draws exactly its rows and rests.
- `node_helper.js` — the stats panel (`statsPanel: true`): CPU of Electron and cage, per core,
  temperature, from `/proc`, only while shown.
- `dev/preview.html` — runs the module in a desktop browser (`python3 -m http.server` in the repo,
  then `/dev/preview.html?height=1200`).

MMM-ChaosTheory has the same simulation (`rule30`, among its eight): a fix to the automaton or
the drawing belongs in both.

The shell (`MMM-Rule30.js`, `node_helper.js`'s stats panel, `dev/preview.html`) is shared in
spirit with the sibling modules (MMM-ChaosTheory, MMM-LorenzAttractor, MMM-DoublePendulum,
MMM-FractalBasins, MMM-LogisticMap, MMM-SymmetricIcons, MMM-ThreeBody, MMM-ChaoticBilliards,
MMM-Atom, MMM-FractalZoom, MMM-Chladni, MMM-SacredGeometry, MMM-Tilings, MMM-PlanetsDance,
MMM-SnowCrystal, MMM-NightSky, MMM-PhotoDeck, MMM-StandardMap, MMM-ChaoticWaterwheel, MMM-DoubleSlit, MMM-Sandpile, MMM-Harmonograph): a fix there probably belongs in the siblings too.

## Measured cost on the Pi

900², 20 fps, Electron + cage, over a 60 s showing (measured in MMM-ChaosTheory): 28% of a core,
20 fps achieved. Hidden: 0.3% (baseline 0.2%).

## Performance findings on the Pi (measured)

- A frame that changes the canvas costs ~2%/fps fixed; beyond that, cost scales with the
  **bounding box of everything changed in the frame**. Full redraws of a 900² canvas at 20 fps
  saturate the pipeline (~150%). JS is never the bottleneck (<3 ms/frame).
- So: draw incrementally, keep each frame's changes spatially compact, and rest when the picture
  is static. Line width, opacity, `rAF` vs timer made no difference.
- MagicMirror applies `electronSwitches` after app ready, so `remote-debugging-port` can't be set
  that way; use `debugStats: true` and a `grim` screenshot to see fps on the Pi.

## Hard constraints: the target device

- **Raspberry Pi 3 B+, 905 MB RAM, 64-bit Debian 13.** Mirror runs Electron 42 in a cage
  Wayland kiosk.
- **No GPU acceleration, and it can't be enabled**: the Pi 3's VideoCore IV only does GLES 2.0,
  Chromium needs ES 3.0 (tested). All canvas drawing is CPU. **No WebGL / three.js.**
- Screen will be **portrait 1200×1920** once mounted (Dell U2413, rotated). Design for portrait.
- Electron baseline is ~0.5% of one core. **Measure, don't guess**: on the Pi,
  `~/.cache/mm-sample.sh 60` prints Electron CPU% and RSS over 60 s. Record before/after numbers
  in the README.
- The mirror rotates pages every 15-30 s (MMM-pages, which hides/shows modules). `suspend()` and
  `resume()` must fire on page changes, or the loop burns CPU 24/7.

## Deploying and testing

- This repo is public so the Pi can `git clone`/`git pull` without credentials. It is meant for
  modules.magicmirror.builders: keep `screenshot.png` and the README's Installation / Update /
  Configuration sections, which the list's checks look for.
- Pi access: `ssh fatherson@raspberrypi.local` (key auth). Module path:
  `~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-Rule30`. Restart: `pm2 restart MagicMirror`
  (pm2 is in `~/.npm-global/bin`). Logs: `pm2 logs MagicMirror`.
- The mirror's **config.js lives in a separate private repo**, `charleswest775/magicmirror-setup`
  (cloned at `~/dev/magicmirror-setup`). Add the module's config block there, then
  `./deploy.sh diff` and `./deploy.sh push` (push validates config before restarting).
  Don't hand-edit config.js on the Pi without `./deploy.sh pull` afterwards.
- Faster iteration: run it in a desktop browser (`dev/preview.html`), then confirm performance
  on the Pi.
- Commit as Charles's GitHub noreply address (set in this repo's git config).
