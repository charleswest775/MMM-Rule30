/* Rule 30: chaos from the simplest rule there is. A row of cells, each on or off; each new row,
 * a cell is on if its left neighbour, or else itself or its right neighbour, was on:
 *   new = left XOR (centre OR right)
 * (Wolfram's elementary cellular automaton number 30, 1983). From one cell it grows a pattern
 * regular on the left and random-looking on the right, whose centre column has passed every
 * test of randomness tried on it: Mathematica used it to make random numbers.
 *
 * Drawn a row at a time from the top, a strip at a time for the Pi; the rows are computed on a
 * line wide enough never to reach its ends, so what's shown is as on an endless line.
